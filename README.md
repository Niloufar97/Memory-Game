Javascript project- Hack Your Future

I recently completed a memory game project for my Hack Your Future course using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game features a sleek and responsive design with two difficulty levels. I developed this game after completing a 10-week JavaScript learning journey, which involved exploring DOM manipulation, arrays, array methods, and even APIs. This project encapsulates my learnings and serves as a culmination of my coding journey. I invite you to try out the game and experience the fruits of my labor.
